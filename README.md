Sass is an important tool in a modern Front End Web Developerâ€™s toolbox.
It's used by many developers to make styling web pages with CSS easier and faster. 
In this project, I created a style guide that can act as my own personal and custom Bootstrap that I can drop into any of my projects to speed up styling,
layout and development in general.
